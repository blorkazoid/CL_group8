# CL_group8
group project for the course Computational Linguistics

Getting started:
How do I use git(hub) with VSCode: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_23KUAEtUM

To do:
- get everyone setup and comfortable with git(hub)
- check if F found the correct files

Source of the files:

1 - The valence of dutch words

Link to Valence data: https://osf.io/9htuv/files/osfstorage (data -> valence)

2 - The pseudowords
Gatti file link: https://osf.io/kv9at/files/osfstorage
There is several files in the Rdata file, experiment3 files contain a subset of the words of experiment2 files (so I am loading in exp.2).
Since we just want the words, which file from the experiment, should not matter.
pseudowords_Gatti is called comb_2 in the Rdata file
